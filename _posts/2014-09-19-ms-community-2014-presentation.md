I held a talk "Building modern web in Microsoft world" on this year's [Microsoft Community conference](http://konferencija.mscommunity.ba/). Thanks for everyone who attended. The conference was great as always. [Damir](https://twitter.com/ddamirMVP) and [Enis](https://twitter.com/sahinovic) did a great job organizing it.

You can find the presentation and a sample on my [BitBucket account](https://bitbucket.org/miroslavpopovic/web-ms-demo/). Thanks!
