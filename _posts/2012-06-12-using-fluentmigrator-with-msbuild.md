I have been playing with [FluentMigrator](https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator) lately, trying to implement the features I had with my old, SQL script based tool. 

My plan was to write a blog post about integrating [FluentMigrator](https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator) with [MSBuild](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0k6kkbsd.aspx), but the size kind of went out of hand. Instead of splitting it to multiple blog posts, I decided to write a [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/) article instead.

Here's the link if you are interested: [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/402430/Using-FluentMigrator-with-MSBuild](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/402430/Using-FluentMigrator-with-MSBuild)
