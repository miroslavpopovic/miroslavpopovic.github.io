On Wednesday, 29. April, I'm holding a talk ["Tales from the client side"](https://msnetwork.ba/conference/sessions#se2313) on 5th Microsoft Bosnia and Herzegovina [NetWork conference](https://msnetwork.ba/). The samples and presentation are available at https://github.com/miroslavpopovic/msnetwork5-sample.

At Saturday, 9. May I'm heading to Čakovec Croatia for [Weblica](http://weblica.hr/) conference, where I'm holding a talk "Building modern web in Microsoft world".

Looking forward to them!
