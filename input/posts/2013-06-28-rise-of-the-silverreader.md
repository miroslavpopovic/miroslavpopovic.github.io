Yes, you read that right. Rise of the [SilverReader](http://silverreader.com/), not [Rise of the Silver Surfer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486576/).

Right after [the news](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html) that shocked the world (at least our world) my friend [Radenko Zec](http://blog.developers.ba/) suggested that we build an alternative to Google Reader. So, few months ago, together with another friend of ours [Igor Markovic](http://igormarkovic.com/), we started working on it and apparently, we [werenâ€™t alone](http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/24/there-is-no-google-reader-replacement-only-alternatives/).

And now, just few days before our beloved Google Reader shuts down, we have published our [first live beta version](http://silverreader.com)!

You can read the [official announcement](http://silverreader.wordpress.com/2013/06/28/going-live/) on [SilverReader blog](http://silverreader.wordpress.com/). Also, Radenko has made a [blog post](http://blog.developers.ba/post/2013/06/28/SilverReader-ultra-fast-Google-Reader-alternative.aspx) explaining a technical side of the story.

Try the [SilverReader](http://silverreader.com) now. If you need any help, or want to submit an idea or issue, visit [SilverReader Knowledge Base](https://silverreader.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/).

Enjoy!
