Aurelia is my client-side framwork of choice, even though I played around with some other choices like Angular and React. On server-side that's ASP.NET Core. Did some work with Node.js too, but still preferring ASP.NET Core.

Since I need to kickstart a few projects, I've looked into the options for doing so with those frameworks. Some time ago, Aurelia had only one official option - `jspm`. Fast forward till today it has: `jspm`, `require.js`, `webpack`, `aurelia-cli`... On the other side, ASP.NET Core 2.0 came out recently with new client-side templates.

My plan is to have this:
 - `webpack` for client-side builds, with features like bundling and hot-reload
 - ECMAScript 2015+ for client-side code
 - use  and have default Individual user authentication on server-side. Let's see how we can achieve that.

## aurelia-cli

[`aurelia-cli`](http://aurelia.io/docs/build-systems/aurelia-cli) is the latest option we have for scaffolding and client-side app building. It follows the same principle as similar tools in other frameworks - [`angular-cli`](https://cli.angular.io/), [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), [`vue-cli`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli), [`ember-cli`](https://ember-cli.com/)...

- ASP.NET Core option does create ASP.NET Core 2.0 application but without user authentication options.

## dotnet new

```
dotnet new -i Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates::*
```

- TypeScript is used
- I don't like the code organization
- No user authentication options
