A lot of things have happen last two-three years for me. I did some experiments (business ones, not with drugs :) ), that proved unsuccessful. During this period I neglected some important and other not so important things. Now I'm trying to get back and reset.

One of neglected things is blogging. So, in my reset mode, I have decided to abandon [Blogger](http://codemind.blogspot.com/) and start fresh on a new platform - [FunnelWeb](http://www.funnelweblog.com/). Currently, a default FunnelWeb theme is used. I plan to tweak it up a little when I get time and/or inspiration.

Old blog posts aren't imported. If you are interested in some of my older ramblings, go to [codemind.blogspot.com](http://codemind.blogspot.com/). This new blog also has a new feed, so please update your feed readers: [http://feeds.feedburner.com/miroslavpopovic/blog](http://feeds.feedburner.com/miroslavpopovic/blog).

Enough of gibberish. What's going on now?

Lately, I'm doing a lot of web development, improving my JavaScript skills and trying to follow a large community behind HTML5. While doing that, I have collected a bunch of links to various web development resources. I got tired of having all those as browser shortcuts, so in an effort to organize it a bit, [Web Resources](http://miroslavpopovic.com/resources/web/) page was made. Hopefully, you'll find something useful there. I'm planing to maintain that list in a future. You can also fork it on [GitHub](https://github.com/miroslavpopovic/resources), if you want to base your own list on it.

Also, expect a link to my new CodeProject article.

See you soon (hopefully).
