Lately, I'm catching up with my reading list - have a bunch of links bookmarked over the last year or so. Found a little gem today that I would like to share...

[Shay Howe](http://shayhowe.com/) put together a fantastic guide on HTML and CSS called [An Advanced Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/). Even seasoned front-end developers can learn a thing or two from it. Highly recommended!

Oh yeah, and there's also [A Beginner's Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).
