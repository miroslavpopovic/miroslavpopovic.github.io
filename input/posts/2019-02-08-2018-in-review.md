![Community activities in 2018](/images/2019-02/community-2018.png)

This is (a bit late) review of the activities I had in 2018., mostly for archival purpose, since I tend to forget things. 

## Seavus

I started to work for [Seavus](https://seavus.com) in September 2017., so 2018. was my first full year there. Some time was necessary to adopt to the new way of working. Before Seavus, I was doing remote / freelance work. Switching to regular working hours, with no overtime and staying up late took a while. As always, there are pros and cons. The biggest pro in my opinion is with social aspect. Seavus managed to attract a huge number of great people (900+ of employees at the moment) and I consider that as its greatest strength. Most of the cons that I have are related to the difference between the work I had before. None of them are really big, and things are improving along the way. 

Seavus Banja Luka office started growing nicely. Btw we [are hiring](https://career.seavus.com/) :). At the end of 2018. I was offered a promotion to Technical Lead with additional assignments - basically to be a face of Seavus in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We'll see how that goes :).

## Conferences and other community events

Now that I see all of it in a list, it's a lot :). Not sure if I'll be able to keep that pace in 2019.

## BLbit user group

[BLbit](https://www.facebook.com/groups/blbit/) continues to be most active [MSCommunity](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mscommunitybih/) user group in Bosnia and Herzegovina by the [number of meetups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/blbit/events/). One of highlights of the last year was a participation in global [.NET Conf](https://www.dotnetconf.net/) event - with a conference watch party and an additional meetup. We had swags too! :)

Last year we have also started to use [Meetup platform](https://www.meetup.com/BLbitUG/) and became members of [.NET Foundation](https://www.meetup.com/pro/dotnet/). Recently, we have also created a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/blbitug) and we are still on [Eventbrite too](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/korisnicka-grupa-blbit-banja-luka-3287790552).

Hopefully, we will able to keep going strong this year too.

## Plans for 2019

Granted, there will be more responsibilities in Seavus, with the promotion, but I don't plan to neglect the community engagement. Might tune down a bit with the number of community events, but will try to be more active with my blog (yeah, not the first time I planned that) and open-source contributions.
