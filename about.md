My name is Miroslav Popovic. I am somewhat independent web and .NET development consultant, currently employed at [Abacus Solutions & Consulting](http://abacussol.com/v2).

I am also one of the leaders of the local [HTML5 and JavaScript](http://www.developers.ba/) / [INETA](http://europe.ineta.org/UserGroups/Browse/tabid/166/ctl/Details/mid/602/gid/2350/Default.aspx) [user group](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/110019016262746200628) and an occasional speaker on dev conferences in Bosnia and Hercegovina and region.
